# File Organizer

This Python script automatically organizes the files in your Downloads folder into designated folders based on their file extensions.

## How It Works

The script scans the Downloads folder, identifies files by their extensions, and moves them into appropriate folders such as Pictures, Videos, Music, and Documents.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it with Python from your command line:

```bash
python file_organizer.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
